# ClawHub CLI

SunClaw has two command-line entry points for ClawHub:

- `sunclaw skills` and `sunclaw plugins` install and manage ClawHub packages
  inside SunClaw.
- The standalone `clawhub` CLI handles publisher workflows such as login,
  publish, transfer, and sync.

## Discover and install

Use SunClaw commands when you want to install or update packages for a local
SunClaw agent or Gateway.

```bash
sunclaw skills search "calendar"
sunclaw skills install <slug>
sunclaw skills update <slug>
sunclaw skills verify <slug>

sunclaw plugins search "calendar"
sunclaw plugins install clawhub:<package>
sunclaw plugins update <id-or-npm-spec>
```

Skill installs target the active workspace `skills/` directory by default. Add
`--global` to install into the shared managed skills directory.

Plugin installs use the `clawhub:` prefix when you want ClawHub resolution
instead of npm or another install source.

## Publish and maintain

Install the standalone ClawHub CLI for publisher workflows:

```bash
npm i -g clawhub
clawhub login
```

Publish plugin packages with `clawhub package publish`:

```bash
clawhub package publish your-org/your-plugin --dry-run
clawhub package publish your-org/your-plugin
clawhub package publish your-org/your-plugin@v1.0.0
```

Publish skill folders with `clawhub skill publish`:

```bash
clawhub skill publish ./skills/review-helper
clawhub skill publish ./skills/review-helper --version 1.0.0
```

When local skill scan state or package ownership needs maintenance, use the
relevant standalone command:

```bash
clawhub sync --all
clawhub package transfer @old-owner/package --to new-owner
```
