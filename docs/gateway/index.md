## 5-minute local startup

<Steps>
  <Step title="Start the Gateway">

```bash
sunclaw gateway --port 18789
# debug/trace mirrored to stdio
sunclaw gateway --port 18789 --verbose
# force-kill listener on selected port, then start
sunclaw gateway --force
```

  </Step>

  <Step title="Verify service health">

```bash
sunclaw gateway status
sunclaw status
sunclaw logs --follow
```

Healthy baseline: `Runtime: running`, `Connectivity probe: ok`, and `Capability: ...` that matches what you expect. Use `sunclaw gateway status --require-rpc` when you need read-scope RPC proof, not just reachability.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Validate channel readiness">

```bash
sunclaw channels status --probe
```

With a reachable gateway this runs live per-account channel probes and optional audits.
If the gateway is unreachable, the CLI falls back to config-only channel summaries instead
of live probe output.

  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
Gateway config reload watches the active config file path (resolved from profile/state defaults, or `SUNCLAW_CONFIG_PATH` when set).
Default mode is `gateway.reload.mode="hybrid"`.
After the first successful load, the running process serves the active in-memory config snapshot; successful reload swaps that snapshot atomically.
</Note>

## Runtime model

- One always-on process for routing, control plane, and channel connections.
- Single multiplexed port for:
  - WebSocket control/RPC
  - HTTP APIs (`/v1/models`, `/v1/embeddings`, `/v1/chat/completions`, `/v1/responses`, `/tools/invoke`)
  - Plugin HTTP routes, such as optional `/api/v1/admin/rpc`
  - Control UI and hooks
- Default bind mode: `loopback`.
- Auth is required by default. Shared-secret setups use
  `gateway.auth.token` / `gateway.auth.password` (or
  `SUNCLAW_GATEWAY_TOKEN` / `SUNCLAW_GATEWAY_PASSWORD`), and non-loopback
  reverse-proxy setups can use `gateway.auth.mode: "trusted-proxy"`.

## OpenAI-compatible endpoints

SunClaw's highest-leverage compatibility surface is now:

- `GET /v1/models`
- `GET /v1/models/{id}`
- `POST /v1/embeddings`
- `POST /v1/chat/completions`
- `POST /v1/responses`

Why this set matters:

- Most Open WebUI, LobeChat, and LibreChat integrations probe `/v1/models` first.
- Many RAG and memory pipelines expect `/v1/embeddings`.
- Agent-native clients increasingly prefer `/v1/responses`.

Planning note:

- `/v1/models` is agent-first: it returns `sunclaw`, `sunclaw/default`, and `sunclaw/<agentId>`.
- `sunclaw/default` is the stable alias that always maps to the configured default agent.
- Use `x-sunclaw-model` when you want a backend provider/model override; otherwise the selected agent's normal model and embedding setup stays in control.

All of these run on the main Gateway port and use the same trusted operator auth boundary as the rest of the Gateway HTTP API.

Admin HTTP RPC (`POST /api/v1/admin/rpc`) is a separate, default-off plugin route for host tooling that cannot use WebSocket RPC. See [Admin HTTP RPC](/plugins/admin-http-rpc).

### Port and bind precedence

| Setting      | Resolution order                                             |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Gateway port | `--port` → `SUNCLAW_GATEWAY_PORT` → `gateway.port` → `18789` |
| Bind mode    | CLI/override → `gateway.bind` → `loopback`                   |

Installed gateway services record the resolved `--port` in supervisor metadata. After changing `gateway.port`, run `sunclaw doctor --fix` or `sunclaw gateway install --force` so launchd/systemd/schtasks starts the process on the new port.

Gateway startup uses the same effective port and bind when it seeds local
Control UI origins for non-loopback binds. For example, `--bind lan --port 3000`
seeds `http://localhost:3000` and `http://127.0.0.1:3000` before runtime
validation runs. Add any remote browser origins, such as HTTPS proxy URLs, to
`gateway.controlUi.allowedOrigins` explicitly.

### Hot reload modes

| `gateway.reload.mode` | Behavior                                   |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `off`                 | No config reload                           |
| `hot`                 | Apply only hot-safe changes                |
| `restart`             | Restart on reload-required changes         |
| `hybrid` (default)    | Hot-apply when safe, restart when required |

## Operator command set

```bash
sunclaw gateway status
sunclaw gateway status --deep   # adds a system-level service scan
sunclaw gateway status --json
sunclaw gateway install
sunclaw gateway restart
sunclaw gateway stop
sunclaw secrets reload
sunclaw logs --follow
sunclaw doctor
```

`gateway status --deep` is for extra service discovery (LaunchDaemons/systemd system
units/schtasks), not a deeper RPC health probe.

## Multiple gateways (same host)

Most installs should run one gateway per machine. A single gateway can host multiple
agents and channels.

You only need multiple gateways when you intentionally want isolation or a rescue bot.

Useful checks:

```bash
sunclaw gateway status --deep
sunclaw gateway probe
```

What to expect:

- `gateway status --deep` can report `Other gateway-like services detected (best effort)`
  and print cleanup hints when stale launchd/systemd/schtasks installs are still around.
- `gateway probe` can warn about `multiple reachable gateways` when more than one target
  answers.
- If that is intentional, isolate ports, config/state, and workspace roots per gateway.

Checklist per instance:

- Unique `gateway.port`
- Unique `SUNCLAW_CONFIG_PATH`
- Unique `SUNCLAW_STATE_DIR`
- Unique `agents.defaults.workspace`

Example:

```bash
SUNCLAW_CONFIG_PATH=~/.sunclaw/a.json SUNCLAW_STATE_DIR=~/.sunclaw-a sunclaw gateway --port 19001
SUNCLAW_CONFIG_PATH=~/.sunclaw/b.json SUNCLAW_STATE_DIR=~/.sunclaw-b sunclaw gateway --port 19002
```

Detailed setup: [/gateway/multiple-gateways](/gateway/multiple-gateways).

## Remote access

Preferred: Tailscale/VPN.
Fallback: SSH tunnel.

```bash
ssh -N -L 18789:127.0.0.1:18789 user@host
```

Then connect clients locally to `ws://127.0.0.1:18789`.

<Warning>
SSH tunnels do not bypass gateway auth. For shared-secret auth, clients still
must send `token`/`password` even over the tunnel. For identity-bearing modes,
the request still has to satisfy that auth path.
</Warning>

See: [Remote Gateway](/gateway/remote), [Authentication](/gateway/authentication), [Tailscale](/gateway/tailscale).

## Supervision and service lifecycle

Use supervised runs for production-like reliability.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="macOS (launchd)">

```bash
sunclaw gateway install
sunclaw gateway status
sunclaw gateway restart
sunclaw gateway stop
```

Use `sunclaw gateway restart` for restarts. Do not chain `sunclaw gateway stop` and `sunclaw gateway start` as a restart substitute.

On macOS, `gateway stop` uses `launchctl bootout` by default — this removes the LaunchAgent from the current boot session without persisting a disable, so KeepAlive auto-recovery still works after unexpected crashes and `gateway start` re-enables cleanly. To persistently suppress auto-respawn across reboots, pass `--disable`: `sunclaw gateway stop --disable`.

LaunchAgent labels are `ai.sunclaw.gateway` (default) or `ai.sunclaw.<profile>` (named profile). `sunclaw doctor` audits and repairs service config drift.

  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Linux (systemd user)">

```bash
sunclaw gateway install
systemctl --user enable --now sunclaw-gateway[-<profile>].service
sunclaw gateway status
```

For persistence after logout, enable lingering:

```bash
sudo loginctl enable-linger <user>
```

Manual user-unit example when you need a custom install path:

```ini
[Unit]
Description=SunClaw Gateway
After=network-online.target
Wants=network-online.target

[Service]
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/sunclaw gateway --port 18789
Restart=always
RestartSec=5
TimeoutStopSec=30
TimeoutStartSec=30
SuccessExitStatus=0 143
KillMode=control-group

[Install]
WantedBy=default.target
```

  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Windows (native)">

```powershell
sunclaw gateway install
sunclaw gateway status --json
sunclaw gateway restart
sunclaw gateway stop
```

Native Windows managed startup uses a Scheduled Task named `SunClaw Gateway`
(or `SunClaw Gateway (<profile>)` for named profiles). If Scheduled Task
creation is denied, SunClaw falls back to a per-user Startup-folder launcher
that points at `gateway.cmd` inside the state directory.

  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Linux (system service)">

Use a system unit for multi-user/always-on hosts.

```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable --now sunclaw-gateway[-<profile>].service
```

Use the same service body as the user unit, but install it under
`/etc/systemd/system/sunclaw-gateway[-<profile>].service` and adjust
`ExecStart=` if your `sunclaw` binary lives elsewhere.

Do not also let `sunclaw doctor --fix` install a user-level gateway service for the same profile/port. Doctor refuses that automatic install when it finds a system-level SunClaw gateway service; use `SUNCLAW_SERVICE_REPAIR_POLICY=external` when the system unit owns the lifecycle.

  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Dev profile quick path

```bash
sunclaw --dev setup
sunclaw --dev gateway --allow-unconfigured
sunclaw --dev status
```

Defaults include isolated state/config and base gateway port `19001`.

## Protocol quick reference (operator view)

- First client frame must be `connect`.
- Gateway returns `hello-ok` snapshot (`presence`, `health`, `stateVersion`, `uptimeMs`, limits/policy).
- `hello-ok.features.methods` / `events` are a conservative discovery list, not
  a generated dump of every callable helper route.
- Requests: `req(method, params)` → `res(ok/payload|error)`.
- Common events include `connect.challenge`, `agent`, `chat`,
  `session.message`, `session.operation`, `session.tool`, `sessions.changed`,
  `presence`, `tick`, `health`, `heartbeat`, pairing/approval lifecycle events,
  and `shutdown`.

Agent runs are two-stage:

1. Immediate accepted ack (`status:"accepted"`)
2. Final completion response (`status:"ok"|"error"`), with streamed `agent` events in between.

See full protocol docs: [Gateway Protocol](/gateway/protocol).

## Operational checks

### Liveness

- Open WS and send `connect`.
- Expect `hello-ok` response with snapshot.

### Readiness

```bash
sunclaw gateway status
sunclaw channels status --probe
sunclaw health
```

### Gap recovery

Events are not replayed. On sequence gaps, refresh state (`health`, `system-presence`) before continuing.

## Common failure signatures

| Signature                                                      | Likely issue                                                                    |
| -------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `refusing to bind gateway ... without auth`                    | Non-loopback bind without a valid gateway auth path                             |
| `another gateway instance is already listening` / `EADDRINUSE` | Port conflict                                                                   |
| `Gateway start blocked: set gateway.mode=local`                | Config set to remote mode, or local-mode stamp is missing from a damaged config |
| `unauthorized` during connect                                  | Auth mismatch between client and gateway                                        |

## Safety guarantees

- Gateway protocol clients fail fast when Gateway is unavailable (no implicit direct-channel fallback).
- Invalid/non-connect first frames are rejected and closed.
- Graceful shutdown emits `shutdown` event before socket close.
