SunClaw core is written in TypeScript. **Node is the recommended runtime**.
Bun is not recommended for the Gateway — known issues with WhatsApp and
Telegram channels; see [Bun (experimental)](/install/bun) for details.

Companion apps exist for macOS (menu bar app) and mobile nodes (iOS/Android). Windows and
Linux companion apps are planned, but the Gateway is fully supported today.
Native companion apps for Windows are also planned; the Gateway is recommended via WSL2.

- Install guide: [Getting Started](/start/getting-started)
- Gateway runbook: [Gateway](/gateway)
- Gateway configuration: [Configuration](/gateway/configuration)
- Service status: `sunclaw gateway status`

## Gateway service install (CLI)

Use one of these (all supported):

- Wizard (recommended): `sunclaw onboard --install-daemon`
- Direct: `sunclaw gateway install`
- Configure flow: `sunclaw configure` → select **Gateway service**
- Repair/migrate: `sunclaw doctor` (offers to install or fix the service)

The service target depends on OS:

- macOS: LaunchAgent (`ai.sunclaw.gateway` or `ai.sunclaw.<profile>`; legacy `com.sunclaw.*`)
- Linux/WSL2: systemd user service (`sunclaw-gateway[-<profile>].service`)
- Native Windows: Scheduled Task (`SunClaw Gateway` or `SunClaw Gateway (<profile>)`), with a per-user Startup-folder login item fallback if task creation is denied
