A sane workflow for working on the SunClaw agent runtime in SunClaw.

## Type checking and linting

- Default local gate: `pnpm check`
- Build gate: `pnpm build` when the change can affect build output, packaging, or lazy-loading/module boundaries
- Full landing gate for agent-runtime changes: `pnpm check && pnpm test`

## Running Agent Runtime Tests

Run the agent-runtime test set directly with Vitest:

```bash
pnpm test \
  "src/agents/agent-*.test.ts" \
  "src/agents/embedded-agent-*.test.ts" \
  "src/agents/agent-tools*.test.ts" \
  "src/agents/agent-settings.test.ts" \
  "src/agents/agent-tool-definition-adapter*.test.ts" \
  "src/agents/agent-hooks/**/*.test.ts"
```

To include the live provider exercise:

```bash
SUNCLAW_LIVE_TEST=1 pnpm test src/agents/embedded-agent-runner-extraparams.live.test.ts
```

This covers the main agent runtime unit suites:

- `src/agents/agent-*.test.ts`
- `src/agents/embedded-agent-*.test.ts`
- `src/agents/agent-tools*.test.ts`
- `src/agents/agent-settings.test.ts`
- `src/agents/agent-tool-definition-adapter.test.ts`
- `src/agents/agent-hooks/*.test.ts`

## Manual testing

Recommended flow:

- Run the gateway in dev mode:
  - `pnpm gateway:dev`
- Trigger the agent directly:
  - `pnpm sunclaw agent --message "Hello" --thinking low`
- Use the TUI for interactive debugging:
  - `pnpm tui`

For tool call behavior, prompt for a `read` or `exec` action so you can see tool streaming and payload handling.

## Clean slate reset

State lives under the SunClaw state directory. Default is `~/.sunclaw`. If `SUNCLAW_STATE_DIR` is set, use that directory instead.

To reset everything:

- `sunclaw.json` for config
- `agents/<agentId>/agent/auth-profiles.json` for model auth profiles (API keys + OAuth)
- `credentials/` for provider/channel state that still lives outside the auth profile store
- `agents/<agentId>/sessions/` for agent session history
- `agents/<agentId>/sessions/sessions.json` for the session index
- `sessions/` if legacy paths exist
- `workspace/` if you want a blank workspace

If you only want to reset sessions, delete `agents/<agentId>/sessions/` for that agent. If you want to keep auth, leave `agents/<agentId>/agent/auth-profiles.json` and any provider state under `credentials/` in place.
